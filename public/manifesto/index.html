<li>Hackers solve problems and build things. he believes in freedom and mutual help.</li>
<li>To be accepted as a hacker, you have to behave as though you have this kind of attitude yourself. and to behave as such, you have to really believe the attitude.</li>
<li>Becoming the kind of person who believes these things is important for <em>me</em> - to help me keep learning and stay motivated.</li>
<li>As with every other creative art, the most effective way to become a master is to <em>imitate the mindset of masters</em> - not just intellectually but emotionally as well.</li>

<p>if you really want to become a hacker, repeat these steps until you believe them:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.</strong>
To be a hacker you have to get a thrill from solving problems, sharpening your mind and skills and intelligence.
I&rsquo;ll need to become this kind of person to make it as a hacker.
Also I need to develop faith in my own learning capacity. Realize that if I tackle problem piece by piece, even when I don&rsquo;t know enough, I&rsquo;ll learn enough to solve the next piece - and so on, until I&rsquo;m done.</li>
<li><strong>No problem should ever be solved twice.</strong>
Creative brain is a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn&rsquo;t be wasted on reinventing the wheel when there are so many new fascinating problems out there.
To behave like a hacker, realize that the thinking time of other hackers is precious - so much so that it&rsquo;s almost a moral duty to share information, solve problems and give the solutions away so other hackers can solve new problems instead of having to perpetually readdress old ones.
You do not necessarily have to share away all your discoveries and creative products, though hackers that do are the ones that get most respect from other hackers. Give away and sell enough to keep you in food and rent and computer in life. It&rsquo;s more than fine to use your hacking skills to support a family or even get rich as long as you don&rsquo;t forget your loyalty to your art and your fellow hackers while doing it.</li>
<li><strong>Boredom and mindlessness are evil.</strong>
Hackers and creative people in general should never be bored or have to do stupid, repetitive work, because when this happens this means they aren&rsquo;t doing what only they can do - solve new problems. This is waste of potential and creative energy.
To behave like a hacker, believe this - you want to automate the boring bits as much as possible, not just for yourself, but for everybody else(esp. for other hackers.)
<em>nobody who can think should ever be forced into a situation that bores them.</em></li>
<li><strong>Freedom is good.</strong>
Hackers are by nature anti-authoritarian. Anyone who can give you orders can stop you from solving whatever problem you&rsquo;re fascinated by - and given the way authoritarian minds work, will generally find some appallingly stupid reason to do so. So the authoritarian attitude has to be fought wherever you find it, lest it restrict me or other hackers.
This isn&rsquo;t the same as fighting all authority. Children need to be guided and criminals restrained. A hacker may agree to accept some kinds of authority in order to get something he wants more than the time he spends following orders. But that&rsquo;s a limited, conscious bargain; the kind of personal surrender authoritarians want is not on offer.
Authoritarians thrive on censorship and secrecy. And they distrust voluntary cooperation and information-sharing — they only like ‘cooperation’ that they control. So to behave like a hacker, you have to develop an instinctive hostility to censorship, secrecy, and the use of force or deception to compel responsible adults. And you have to be willing to act on that belief</li>
<li><strong>Attitude is not substitute for competence.</strong>
To be a hacker, develop some of these attitudes. But beware, copying an attitude won&rsquo;t make you a hacker alone. any more that it will make you a champion athlete or a rock star. Becoming a hacker will take intelligence, practice, dedication, and hard work.
Learn to distrust attitude and respect competence of every kind. Hackers don&rsquo;t let posers waste their time, but they worship competence - especially competence at hacking, but competence at anything is valued. Competence at demanding skill that few can master is esp. good, and competence at demanding skills that involve mental acuteness, craft and concentration is best.
Respect competence, and you&rsquo;ll enjoy developing it in yourself - the hard work and dedication will become kind of intense play rather than routine. This attitude is vital to becoming a hacker.</li>
