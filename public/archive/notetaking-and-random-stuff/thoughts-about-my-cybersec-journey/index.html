<meta name="description" content=" 0a - Thoughts about my Cybersec Journey Over the years, I have explored diverse disciplines within computer science. My interests have spanned programming, operating systems, and the intricacies of Unix and Windows systems. I delved into game development, experimenting with various engines and libraries, resulting in several completed and unfinished projects that provided valuable experience. Amateur 3D modeling with Blender further broadened my skill set. I consistently engage with technical content, including CS/IT conference recordings. My formal training includes CSIRT and Threat Hunting, and I currently hold a CCNA certification. More recently, I have developed an interest in hardware hacking and IoT, though my electronics knowledge is currently limited. This breadth of experience has provided me with a foundation of knowledge that I believe is sufficient for specializing in any area of cybersecurity.

<p>Over the years, I have explored diverse disciplines within computer science. My interests have spanned programming, operating systems, and the intricacies of Unix and Windows systems. I delved into game development, experimenting with various engines and libraries, resulting in several completed and unfinished projects that provided valuable experience. Amateur 3D modeling with Blender further broadened my skill set. I consistently engage with technical content, including CS/IT conference recordings. My formal training includes CSIRT and Threat Hunting, and I currently hold a CCNA certification. More recently, I have developed an interest in hardware hacking and IoT, though my electronics knowledge is currently limited. This breadth of experience has provided me with a foundation of knowledge that I believe is sufficient for specializing in any area of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Specifically, in the next period I&rsquo;d like to improve in the following sub-disciplines(although not necessarily in this order):</p>
<ol>
<li>Reverse Engineering</li>
<li>Bug Bounty</li>
<li>Penetration Testing</li>
<li>SOC Analysis(maybe)</li>
</ol>

<p><code>date: Sat 22:51 10AUG2024</code></p>
<p>I have observed that theoretical learning, such as through passive reading or didactic courses (e.g., HackTheBox Academy lessons), yields minimal practical knowledge retention. Conversely, hands-on experience, gained through practical challenges and labs (e.g., Portswigger Academy, HackTheBox Labs, bug bounty programs), significantly enhances knowledge retention and application. Therefore, I will prioritize practical challenges and adopt a just-in-time learning approach, acquiring knowledge as needed to effectively retain and apply the information.</p>
