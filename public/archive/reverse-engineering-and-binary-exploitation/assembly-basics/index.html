<p><strong>Assembly language</strong> at its basic is an symbolic language that directly ties a language machine can understand and a language that is easy for humans to understand.</p>
<p>An instruction like <code>add rax, 1</code> is simpler than machine shellcode equivalent <code>4883C001</code> or binary machine code <code>01001000 10000011 11000000 00000001</code></p>
<p>There are different processor architectures and each needs a program to be written on different sets of instructions. This is where low-level languages like <code>C</code> come in.</p>
<p><code>C</code> has a complier that compiles a source code to a variety of architectures without writing different source code for each.</p>

  Memory
  <a href="#memory" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a>
</h3>
<p>Memory is where the temporary data and instructions reside when a program is running/doing calculations. This is the first place a CPU goes to retrieve and process data. Very fast but also volatile</p>
<p>There are two types of memory:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cache</li>
<li>Random Access Memory or RAM</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="cache">
  Cache
  <a href="#cache" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a>
</h3>
<p>Cache memory resides withing the CPU and is extremely fast compared to RAM as it runs on the same clock speed. However it is very limited in size and memory.</p>
<p>There are three levels of cache memory, sorted by their physical closeness to CPU</p>

      <tr>
          <td>Level 1 Cache</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>

      <tr>
          <td>Level 3 Cache</td>
          <td>Usually in megabytes (larger than L2), faster than RAM but slower than L1/L2. (Not all CPUs use L3.)</td>
      </tr>

<h3 id="ram">
  RAM
  <a href="#ram" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a>
</h3>
<p>Ram is a larger cache memory and much slower than Cache memory. It&rsquo;s also residing physically further from the CPU, hence used after Cache memory.</p>
<p>When a program starts, all of its data and instructions are loaded to the RAM(from storage) to be accessed whenever necessary by the CPU.</p>
<p>RAM is split into four main segments</p>

  I/O Storage
  <a href="#io-storage" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a>
</h3>
<p>Input/Output devices are storage unit, keyboard, screen etc. The processor can access and control IO devices using <code>Bus Interfaces</code>. These are metallic &lsquo;highways&rsquo; on a PCB that help transmission of electrical charges as binary data.</p>
<p>Each Bus has a capacity of how much electric charge(or bits) it can carry at a given moment. This is usually a multiple of a nibble(half of a byte) up to 128-bits.</p>
<p>Bus interfaces are used to access memory and components outside the CPU. This is why there are countless bus interfaces around the CPU.</p>
<p>By speed here are memory components sorted</p>

  CPU Architecture
  <a href="#cpu-architecture" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a>
</h2>
<p>CPU is the main processing unit within a computer. The CPU contains the <code>Control Unit(CU)</code>, which is in charge of moving and controlling data and there&rsquo;s <code>Arithmetic/Logic Unit(ALU)</code>, which is in charge of performing arithmetic and logical calculations as requested.</p>
<p>Efficiency of a CPU and which instructions it can run depends on its <code>Instruction Set Architecture(ISA)</code>. <code>RISC</code> architecture is based on processing more simple instructions, which takes more cycles but each cycle is shorter and takes less power. <code>CISC</code> architecture is based on processing fewer, more complex instructions, which takes less instructions and fewer cycles but each instruction takes more time and power.</p>
<p>A <code>clock speed</code> refers to each tick given one cycle of an operation that it takes to process a basic instruction, like fetching an address or storing one.</p>
<p>The frequency of cycles is measured in <code>Hertz</code>. Example: CPU speed with 2.0GHz means that it can run 2 billion cycles every second(per core).</p>

<h3 id="instruction-cycle">
  Instruction Cycle

<li>Get the current value at <code>rax</code> (by <code>CU</code>), add <code>1</code> to it (by the <code>ALU</code>).</li>
<li>Store the new value back to <code>rax</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>each processor has its own set of instructions and corresponding machine code. So, each processor type has its Instruction Set Architectures, and each architecture can be further represented in several syntax formats</p>

<li>Instructions - <code>add rax, 1, mov rsp, rax, push rax</code></li>
<li>Registers - <code>rax, rsp, rip</code></li>
<li>Memory Addresses - <code>0xffffffffaa8a25ff, 0x44d0, $rax</code></li>
<li>Data Types - <code>byte, word, double word</code></li>

  Endianness
  <a href="#endianness" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a>
</h4>
<p>An address endianness is the order of its bytes in which they are stored or retrieved from memory. There are two types of endianness: <code>Little-Endian</code> and <code>Big-Endian</code>. With <strong>Little-Endian</strong> processors, the little-end byte of the address is retrieved right-to-left Example: an address <code>0x0011223344556677</code> will be stored in reverse -&gt; <code>0x7766554433221100</code></p>
<p>With <strong>Big-Endian</strong> processors, the big-end byte is retrieved left-to-right</p>
<p>In little endian, if we were to push an address or a string with Assembly, we would have to push it in reverse. For example, if we want to store the word <code>Hello</code>, we would push its bytes in reverse: <code>o</code>, <code>l</code>, <code>l</code>, <code>e</code>, and finally <code>H</code>.</p>

        inc rbx      ; rbx = 1
        mov rcx, 10  ; loop 10 times

loopFib:

        xchg rax, rbx; swap values
        loop loopFib ; </code></pre></div>
<p>In the example above <code>rcx</code> register in <code>mov rcx, 10</code> is a general-purpose register, but for <code>loop</code> it has a special purpose.</p>
<p><code>loop</code> checks <code>rcx</code> value each time that loop block executes and decreases <code>rcx</code> value each time. This loop runs until <code>rcx</code> is 0.</p>
<p>How does <code>loopFib</code> gets executed? <code>loopFib:</code> is just a label which gets translated to an address of <code>add rax, rbx</code> at runtime. While <code>loop loopFib</code> tells assembly where to jump at each iteration. This <code>loop</code> instruction checks that <code>rcx</code>&gt;0 value before executing another loop.</p>

<h3 id="branching">
  Branching
  <a href="#branching" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a>
</h3>
<p>Branching allows <code>jump</code>-ing to any location in the program if a condition is met. The most basic branching instruction is <code>jmp</code> which will always be triggered no matter the conditions.</p>

loopFib:
    add rax, rbx    ; get the next number
    xchg rax, rbx   ; swap values
    jmp loopFib</code></pre></div>
<p>In this example, even though <code>mov rcx, 10</code> is present, it won&rsquo;t affect <code>jmp loopFib</code> because <code>jmp</code> is an unconditional instruction and will continue running the loop forever.</p>

  The Stack
  <a href="#the-stack" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"></a>
</h3>
<p>The Stack is a segment of memory allocated for each program to store data in. It is used to temporarily store and retrieve data. Top of the stack is referred by the Top Stack Pointer <code>rsp</code> and bottom is referred as Base Stack Pointer <code>rbp</code>.</p>
<p>Data can either be <code>push</code>ed or <code>pop</code>&rsquo;d from the stack. <code>push</code> Copies the specified register/address to the top of the stack. <code>pop</code> moves the item at the top of the stat to the specified register/address.</p>
<p>The stack has Last-in First-out (LIFO) design. This means we can only <code>pop</code> out the element that is at the top of the stack. If we <code>push</code> five more elements on top of it, we&rsquo;ll have to pop all of them before accessing that last element.</p>
<p>Before calling <code>functions</code> or <code>syscalls</code> we need to save data to the stack. Otherwise the data will be lost. For example if we wanted to retain the current value at <code>rax</code> and run a syscall, we would first <code>push rax</code> to the stack and then call the function.</p>
<p>Using the stack is very simple. The only thing we should keep in mind is the order we push our registers and the state of the stack to safely restore our data and not restore a different value by pop when a different value is at the top of the stack.</p>
