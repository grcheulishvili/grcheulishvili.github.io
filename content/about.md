# ℹ️ About

### ..myself

I'm a tech enthusiast and hobby writer, driven by an almost pathological need to connect the dots. My journey through life is less a straight line, more a sprawling network of interconnected ideas.&#x20;

My curiosity, a restless companion, guides me through the labyrinth of existence, one cobbled-together project at a time.

### ...my writing

Why this mountain of a text? Simple: I learn best by explaining, and I explain best by writing. Consider it a form of self-administered dialogue, conducted in the public domain of the internet.

Consider these words my digital daisy chain, a trail of thought left for myself (and anyone else curious enough to follow). Writing, for me, is the process of mapping the uncharted territories of my own understanding.
