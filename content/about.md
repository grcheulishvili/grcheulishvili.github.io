## The Operator
I am a Security Engineer and developer focused on **Offensive Security** and **Infrastructure Automation**. 

My background is rooted in general computing and cybersecurity. Unlike the theoretical approach of academia, I learn by **problem-oriented engineering**: breaking complex concepts down into bite-sized coding tasks and building the tools I need to solve them.

## Technical Philosophy
* **Code First:** Theory is necessary, but implementation is proof. I prefer writing a tool to understand a vulnerability over reading a paper about it.
* **Deep Dives:** I do not settle for high-level abstractions. Whether it's understanding the Windows API for malware development or dissecting network packets for CTI, I aim for the fundamental level.

## Core Competencies
* **Languages:** Go, Python, C/C++
* **Infrastructure:** Proxmox VE, Docker, Linux Hardening, AWS.
* **Data & Vis:** PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch (ELK), Grafana.
* **Focus:** Malware Development, Reverse Engineering, Threat Intelligence.
