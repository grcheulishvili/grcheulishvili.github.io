## Mechanism of Action
SSRF occurs when an application fetches a remote resource based on user-supplied URLs without validation. This trust relationship allows an attacker to coerce the server into making requests on their behalf.

## Target Analysis: Stock API
The application uses a specific parameter to query an internal stock management API:

```http
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
...
stockApi=http://stock.weliketoshop.net:8080/product/stock/check?productId=1
```

## Exploitation: Localhost Pivot
By modifying the `stockApi` parameter, we can direct the server to query its own loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`). This is critical because many administrative services listen only on localhost to avoid external exposure.

**Payload:**
```http
stockApi=http://localhost/admin
```

**Result:**
The server responds with the Administrative Interface HTML, which is normally blocked from external IPs.

## Escalation: Authorized Action
Once the internal interface is accessible, we can construct authorized requests by predicting URL structures.

**Payload:**
```http
stockApi=http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos
```

The server executes the request with local privileges, deleting the target user. This demonstrates how SSRF bypasses network-level access controls (firewalls) by utilizing the trusted server as a proxy.
