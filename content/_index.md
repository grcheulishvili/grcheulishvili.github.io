## Security Engineer | Malware Development | Reverse Engineering

I am an offensive security engineer bridging the gap between Red Team operations and Software Engineering.

This site is a collection of my engineering logs. It documents the infrastructure I build, the malware I reverse engineer, and the tools I develop to understand offensive concepts from first principles.

I believe that to truly understand a system, you must be able to build it—and break it—yourself.
