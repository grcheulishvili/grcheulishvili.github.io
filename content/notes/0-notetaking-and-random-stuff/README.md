# 0 - Notetaking and random stuff

Today's date is 2024-07-16.

I document my thoughts in this digital notebook to improve their clarity and ensure they are retained in the long run. My experience shows that writing down ideas significantly enhances their coherence compared to simply thinking about them. This method allows for sustained focus on fleeting insights, enabling future development and analysis.

### Writing rules

Recently, I discovered [Niklas Lünemann's Zettelkasten ](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/)method, a system for organizing thoughts that facilitates the connection of ideas. Its core principles are:

* Each note should contain a single, atomic thought, enabling direct connections between ideas rather than collections of notes.
* Each note, or 'Zettel,' should have a unique identifier, facilitating interlinking and cross-referencing. For organizational clarity, I will adopt an alphanumeric hierarchical designation.

```ჩანაწერების

├── 1a
│   ├── 1a1
│   └── 1a2
└── 1b
    └── 1b1
2
└── 2a
    └── 2a1
```

### Type of notes

My primary focus will be on cybersecurity topics of interest, though I may occasionally explore other subjects. I intend to write predominantly in English, but may incorporate Georgian or other languages as required by the technical nature of the content.
