# 1e2 - SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass \[PortSwigger Lab]

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the `administrator` user.

### Solution:

So basically moving to login page and making a request with random credentials e.g `administrator:1234` produces the following request

`csrf=fa4Q5v3cgV1j8b53G5zEr6Q45BQUFKfA&username=administrator&password=1234`

all we need to do is add `'--` after administrator. which successfully lets us in as an administrator.

I've solved around 20 PortSwigger labs at the time of writing. So the things I've further learned is mainly related to BurpSuite. so having a good knowledge of that is essential.

I've got a fairly good grasp of Access Control vulnerabilities at this point.
